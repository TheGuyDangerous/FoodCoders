# FoodCoders - An OpenSource Cookbook
This repository is a compilation of all of our contributor's favourite recipes compiled into a website. It is meant to *contribute* to, and share your favourite recipes, with just making *tweaks* to the template, and adding their own page of 6 unique dishes. <br> *I am extremely picky about any contributions to keep this project clean and efficient.*
